### Project Overview

This robot, named *Pawzzy*, is meant to entertain your cat while you, the owner, are away. One simple tap on your phone, and you don't have to worry about your cat 
feeling lonely! As you would with a cat toy, this machine takes a toy on a string, launches it, and then moves it around for the cat to try to catch. 

As shown in fig.1, the robot has a launch arm, where the toy is attached to moving reel. Like a fishing rod, this arm rotates forward very fast, and the reel is turned on so that the 
toy is launched at a desired distance.

Then the toy is slowly reeled in as the arm is moved around on the rotating plate, shown in fig.2.

As the toy is being reeled in, the Ultrasonic Sensor at the bottom of the box shown in fig.3 moves close to the direction of the toy, so that if the cat gets close the toy can react and make 
it harder for the cat.
